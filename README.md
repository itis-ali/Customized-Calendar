# Customized-Calendar
This is a customized date-picker interface which can be used in Python projects that use customtkinter as their GUI package.


It is possible to edit this module in order to match with your project's theme. I did customized some buttons the way I desired.

This module can be the command parameter of your CTkEntry widget. As the user clicks that entry a new window will show up to pick the date. The only thing to do is to import it into your project's module.

You may say tkinter originally has DateEntry widget but my response is that if you look for a more modern style customtkinter is a good choice rather than tkinter.
